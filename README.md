There are 4 AI model that is used for this Prediction:
* LDA (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/119OOlRnRuSwqWEDBjG3tCi02xjASwtIn?usp=sharing)
* QDA (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IbV4UQ6GFZdZMAJRU4GKMO0PYHQ-cem_?usp=sharing)
* CNN GoogleNet (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-HXBz9Lx9dr9ITCvyE-jj_07DLnHs8X-?usp=sharing)
* MLP (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tgI5NcKS2J1WFBuhbAv0rYlPNI8uogqY?usp=sharing)

I Am using the PROMISE12 Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tushartalukder1/promise12-2d-dataset

this was a computational biology class project, which i think was rather fun so these model i used probably cant compete with more sophisticated models but think this is a good start for me who had interest in Machine Learning :)
